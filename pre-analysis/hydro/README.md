# Data Summary

## Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC)

> The Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) is an international data centre operating under the auspices of the World
> Meteorological Organization (WMO). Established in 1988 to support the research on global and climate change and
> integrated water resources management, it holds the most substantive collection of quality assured river discharge
> data on global scale.

There is no API available for the GRDC, but the data can be downloaded from the [GRDC Data PORTAL](https://portal.grdc.bafg.de/applications/public.html?publicuser=PublicUser#dataDownload/StationCatalogue).

Unlike ERA5 and GRUN, the GRDC data is not available in a gridded format.
The discharge (streamflow) data is available at station level.

Check out the [FAQ](https://grdc.bafg.de/help/faq/) to define the way to download the data.

## VegDischarge

To route the gridded runoff generated by the VegET model, the mizuRoute river routing model was used, resulting in
routed discharge estimates for over 63,000 river reaches in Africa. The routing tool has 5 different routing algorithms
available: Impulse Response Function-Unit Hydrograph (IRF), Lagrangean-based Kinematic Wave Tracking (KWT), Eulerian
based Kinematic Wave (KW), Muskingum-Cunge (MC), and Diffusive Wave (DW). All 5 algorithms were used for this study.

The usage of KWT or KW is suggested to yield the best results.

## ERA5-Land

### ERA5-Land Monthly Averages

- Covers the period from **January 1950 to 2-3 months before the present**
- ERA5-Land runs at enhanced resolution (9 km) - a regular latitude/longitude grid of 0.1°x0.1° via the CDS catalogue

This document summarizes the units for each variable available in the ERA5-Land **monthly_averaged_reanalysis** dataset via the CDS API.

####  Units for ERA5-Land Monthly Averaged Variables

| Variable                         | Unit     | Description |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| **2m_temperature**               | Kelvin (K) | Air temperature at 2 meters above the surface. To convert to Celsius, subtract 273.15. |
| **total_precipitation**          | m/day    | Total precipitation accumulated over the day, expressed in meters of water equivalent per day. Multiply by 1000 to convert to mm/day. Multiply by the number of days in the month for total monthly precipitation. |
| **surface_runoff**               | m/day    | Surface runoff accumulated over the day, in meters of water equivalent. Multiply by 1000 for mm/day. Multiply by number of days in the month for monthly total. |
| **snow_depth_water_equivalent**  | m        | Instantaneous depth of snow in meters of water equivalent. |
| **potential_evaporation**        | m/day    | Potential evaporation per day in meters. Multiply by 1000 for mm/day. Multiply by number of days in the month for monthly total. |
| **total_evaporation**            | m/day    | Actual evapotranspiration per day in meters. Multiply by 1000 for mm/day. Multiply by number of days in the month for monthly total. |

#### Notes on Data Interpretation

- **Accumulated Variables**:
    - Values are **daily means in meters/day**.
    - To compute **total for a month**:
      `monthly_total = daily_mean × number_of_days_in_month`
    - Example:
      `0.004 m/day × 30 days = 0.12 m`

- **Instantaneous Variables**:
    - Do **not** need accumulation over time.

#### Extracting Data from file

Understanding `stepType`: Handling Instantaneous vs Accumulated Variables in ERA5-Land Monthly Averages

In ERA5-Land monthly reanalysis data, variables are processed differently depending on whether they are **instantaneous
** or **accumulated**. This affects how they are averaged and stored in GRIB files.

**Key `stepType` Values**

| `stepType`  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`avgid`** | Monthly **average of hourly data** that was originally **instantaneous** (e.g., 2m temperature).                                                                      |
| **`avgas`** | Monthly **average of hourly data** that was originally **accumulated**, then **scaled** to a rate (e.g., total precipitation → precipitation rate → monthly average). |

---

Why It Matters

- These different `stepType`s **must be handled separately** when reading GRIB files using tools like `cfgrib`.
- Attempting to read a GRIB file with mixed `stepType`s without filtering will cause errors.

How to Extract Data

Use `cfgrib` with `filter_by_keys` to open each type separately:

```python
import xarray as xr

# For instantaneous variables (e.g., 2m_temperature)
ds_instant = xr.open_dataset("data.grib", engine="cfgrib",
                             backend_kwargs={"filter_by_keys": {"stepType": "avgid"}})

# For accumulated variables (e.g., total_precipitation)
ds_accum = xr.open_dataset("data.grib", engine="cfgrib",
                           backend_kwargs={"filter_by_keys": {"stepType": "avgas"}})
```

You can then merge the datasets if they share compatible dimensions.

## GRUN

The dataset contains a gridded global reconstruction of monthly runoff timeseries.
The data are at monthly resolution covering the period 1902-2014 on a **0.5 degrees (WGS84)
grid in units of mm/day**
The data are provided in a NetCDFv4 file, that is downloadable from the GRUN repository.
