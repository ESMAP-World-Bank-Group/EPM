# Cursor Rules for EPM Project

## General Guidelines
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guide
- Write clear, well-documented code with docstrings
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- This is an Energy Planning Model (EPM) project
- Maintain compatibility with GAMS integration
- Follow existing code patterns in the epm/ directory
- Document any changes to model equations or input/output formats
- You are working as an energy modeller, not a software product engineer
- Do not modify .gms files unless explicitly requested

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Write tests for new functionality when appropriate
- Prioritize stability, readability, and reproducibility over refactoring
- Keep code simple, compact, and human-readable
- Add clear docstrings to functions; avoid unnecessary abstractions

## Workflow Guidelines
- Make small, logically scoped commits
- Ask before running long or computationally expensive tasks
- Ask before running token-expensive operations
