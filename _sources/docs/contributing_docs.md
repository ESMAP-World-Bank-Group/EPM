# Contributing to the documentation

All markdown files for the documentation are in the `docs/` folder. To contribute:

- You can improve an existing page by editing its `.md` file. For example, update `docs/model_formulation.md` to improve the model formulation section.
- You can add a new page by creating a new markdown file in `docs/`. If you do this, donâ€™t forget to:
  1. Add the new file to the `_toc.yml` file so it appears in the documentation sidebar.

## How to update and improve the documentation

1. Go to the `docs/` folder.
2. Edit an existing markdown file or create a new one.
3. If you add a new file, update `_toc.yml` to include it in the navigation.
4. Add your changes to git and push them to the `main` branch.

Thank you for helping improve this project.
