# Installation

## 1. Clone the repository
 - Use the terminal to go to the location you want to clone the repository.
 - Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/ESMAP-World-Bank-Group/EPM.git`


## 2. Create and activate branch

We suggest to create a new branch for your work. This way, you can work on your own branch and merge it to the main branch when you are done.
- To see the branch you are in, run the command: `git branch`
- Create (if it doesn't exist yet) and change to the branch you want to work on: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`. `branch-name` should be a descriptive name of the use case you are working on, e.g., guinea.
- Youâ€™ve created a new branch locally. In order to have your code stored on the remote repository as well, you should push your local branch to the remote repository: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

## 3. Launch the model

There are three ways to run the model:
- Using GAMS Studio (recommended for debugging)
- Using Python (recommended for running the model with multiple scenarios)
- Using Excel (not recommended)

There are two ways to include input data:
- A single .xlsx file with all data
- A folder with a list of .csv files with the data (recommended)

Those are detailed hereafter.
