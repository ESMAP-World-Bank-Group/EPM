# EPM Output Overview

The postprocessing pipeline reads the GAMS run artifacts located under each scenario folder (for example `output/<run_id>/<scenario>/`). Two types of result files are produced when the model is executed with `REPORTSHORT = 0`:

- `epmresults.gdx` – the complete data dump written by the `execute_unload` statement in `generate_report.gms`.
- Comma-separated files created by the embedded GAMS Connect block in `generate_report.gms`. Each CSV mirrors the identically named GDX symbol and is stored next to the scenario GDX file.

Unless stated otherwise, the columns `epmresults.gdx` and `CSV export` indicate whether each symbol is produced by default when `REPORTSHORT = 0`.

## Tips

- Large CSVs can be slimmed down using `reduce_definition_csv` in `postprocessing.py` (keeps first, middle, last year).
- When `REPORTSHORT = 1`, only `pYearlyCostsZone`, `pYearlyCostsZoneFull`, and `pEnergyBalance` are exported; the tables below assume the default detailed reporting.
