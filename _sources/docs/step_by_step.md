# Step-by-step guide

_Last update: Dec 2024_

This guide will walk you through the recommended process of running the Electricity Planning Model (EPM).

1. **Clone the repository**:
    - Use the terminal to go to the location you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/ESMAP-World-Bank-Group/EPM.git`


2. **Create and activate branch**:

- Create a new branch for your work. This way, you can work on your own branch (and merge some of the nice feature you have developed to the main branch when you are done):
    - To see the branch you are in, run the command: `git branch` 
    - Create and change to the branch you want to work on: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`. `branch-name` should be a descriptive name of the use case you are working on, e.g., `guinea`.
    - Youâ€™ve created a new branch locally and now want to push it to the remote repository, to save your changes remotely: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

3. **Modify the input files**:

- Look at the `input` folder for examples of the input files. We recommend using a folder with a list of `.csv` files with the data. Modify individual files as needed.
- This step may cause a number of bugs, if you start from an existing EPM version relying on an excel version of the input files. Recommended process is to debug through GAMS Studio. 
  - Following recommendations from section **How to run EPM**, run `WB_EPM_v8_5_main.gms` with the following command line arguments: `--READER CONNECT_CSV`. This ensures that inputs are read from default csv files in the `input` folder (checkout `WB_EPM_input_readers.gms` to see what are the specified default csv file for each parameter). If some of your new csv files are not correctly specified, this will raise some bugs when running the gams file. 
    - To understand and correct the bugs, the recommended approach includes
      1. Adding successively the corresponding reading lines for each csv file, to understand which file is causing the problems. For instance, simply using at first:
      ```gams
      $onEmbeddedCode Connect:
        
      - CSVReader:
          trace: 0
          file: input/data/pAvailability.csv
          name: pAvailability
          indexColumns: [1]
          header: [1,2]
          type: par
    
      - GDXWriter:
          file: %GDX_INPUT%.gdx
          symbols: all
      $offEmbeddedCode
      ```
      and then, when this line works, add successively the other ones.
    2. Comparing the gdx file obtained with this approach, with the one obtained using the input excel file. To obtain the second one, either use input gdx files from previous case studies, already available. Or run the code with `--READER CONNECT_EXCEL` to obtain the excel output.
- Once the code runs with `--READER CONNECT_CSV`, it is important to modify similarly the code section of `WB_EPM_input_readers.gms` which starts with `$elseIfI.READER %READER% == CONNECT_CSV_PYTHON`. This code section will be used when input files are read from a scenario file. You should use copy paste the same code as before, simply changing for each parameter how the file is specified. For example:
    ```gams 
    - CSVReader:
    trace: 0
    file: %pAvailability%
    name: pAvailability
    indexColumns: [1]
    header: [1,2]
    type: par
    ```
- Create the `scenario_baseline.csv` file that contains the baseline scenario. Look at the `input` folder for an example. The `scenario_baseline.csv` provides the path to all the `.csv` input data for the baseline scenario.
- Create the `scenarios_specification.csv` file that contains the specification of the scenarios. Look at the `input` folder for an example. By default, the model will run the baseline scenario. The `scenarios_specification.csv` provides the path to the `.csv` input data that are scenario-specific.

4. **Modify the code files**:

- If there is an existing EPM version for the case study you are doing, erase the `WB_EPM_v8_5_base.gms` and `WB_EPM_v8_5_Report.gms` files, which are specific to the country or region version. Simply copy paste your available files to the `country` branch instead. Otherwise, disregard this step.

5. **Run the model**:

- Use `run_epm.py` or a notebook to launch the code. We suggest to only limit to one scenario during the debugging phase. Here, we have selected the `baseline` that is automatically included (even if it's not in `scenarios_specification.csv`). For example:

```python
# Define the path to the folder
PATH_GAMS = {
    'path_main_file': 'WB_EPM_v8_5_main.gms',
    'path_base_file': 'WB_EPM_v8_5_base.gms',
    'path_report_file': 'WB_EPM_v8_5_Report.gms',
    'path_reader_file': 'WB_EPM_input_readers.gms',
    'path_cplex_file': 'cplex.opt'
}

# Select the scenarios to run in the selected_scenarios list
launch_epm_multi_scenarios(
    scenario_baseline='input/scenario_baseline.csv',
    scenarios_specification='input/scenarios_specification.csv',
    selected_scenarios=['baseline'],
    cpu=1
    )
```

This code will call .gms file to run the model. Ensure that the code works as expected and that the `.gdx` output is as expected. The model will generate output files in the `output` folder, with a specific folder for each simulation defined by the datetime.

5. **Process the results**:

- Use postprocessing notebook. The postprocessing notebook will help you to visualize the results and compare the scenarios. The notebook will read the output files and generate the plots and tables for the results.
- You only need to enter the name of the folder that contains the result of the simulation. The code will actually also considers the input file.
- The code then generates the plots and tables for the results.

6. **Running on remote server**:

If the code has worked locally, you can run the code on a remote server. This is useful when you have a large number of scenarios to run or when you need to run the model for a long time.

- Enter your credential.
- Run the code with Python.

For example, with GAMS Engine. You can know run the same function, but with the path to the GAMS Engine file.
```python
launch_epm_multi_scenarios(
    scenario_baseline='input/scenario_baseline.csv',
    scenarios_specification='input/scenarios_specification.csv',
    selected_scenarios=['baseline'],
    cpu=1,
    path_engine_file='Engine_Base.gms
    )
```
