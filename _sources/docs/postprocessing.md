# Postprocessing of the results

THis section describes the postprocessing of the results of the simulation. It enables the user to quickly visualize the results and generate standardized figures.

## Structure

The postprocessing is divided into two main parts:
- `epm/utils.py`: Contains the functions to read the results and generate the figures.
- `epm/postprocessing/postprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to run the postprocessing. An example of the postprocessing is provided in the notebook. User can adapt the code to their needs.
