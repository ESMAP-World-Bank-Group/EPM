# Postprocessing Output Overview

The postprocessing pipeline reads the GAMS run artifacts located under each scenario folder (for example `output/<run_id>/<scenario>/`). Two types of result files are produced when the model is executed with `REPORTSHORT = 0`:

- `epmresults.gdx` â€“ the complete data dump written by the `execute_unload` statement in `generate_report.gms`.
- Comma-separated files created by the embedded GAMS Connect block in `generate_report.gms`. Each CSV mirrors the identically named GDX symbol and is stored next to the scenario GDX file.

The tables below document which metrics are sent to both outputs by default and which ones remain GDX-only unless manually converted.

## Outputs exported to both `epmresults.gdx` and CSV

These symbols are always included in the GDX dump and are also written to CSV by the Connect workflow. All locations are relative to the scenario folder (`output/<run_id>/<scenario>/`).

## Tips

- Large CSVs can be slimmed down using `reduce_definition_csv` in `postprocessing.py` (keeps first, middle, last year).
- When `REPORTSHORT = 1`, only `pYearlyCostsZone`, `pYearlyCostsZoneFull`, and `pEnergyBalance` are exported; the tables above assume the default detailed reporting.
