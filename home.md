# ESMAP Energy Planning Group Library
Welcome to the Energy Planning Group Library, a collection of tools and models developed by the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) to support electricity system planning at national and regional levels.

This open-source library provides Python-based and GAMS-based tools to conduct robust, data-driven assessments of power systems—supporting policy makers, planners, and analysts working on:

- Renewable energy integration
- Power system flexibility analysis
- Long-term capacity expansion
- Multi-zone dispatch modeling

 ## Main Tool: Electricity Planning Model (EPM)
At the core of this library is the Electricity Planning Model (EPM)—a long-term, multi-year, multi-zone capacity expansion and dispatch model. EPM is designed to identify cost-optimal investment and operational strategies for electricity systems.

Key Features:
- Models power generation, transmission, and dispatch over multiple years and zones
- Minimizes the net present value of total system costs, including:
  - Fixed and annualized capital costs
  - Variable generation and fuel costs
- Supports planning under various policy, demand, and technology scenarios
