# Master Plan Guidance

We describe a generic process to follow to build a country Master plan.
The master plan enables to:

### Generator list  

Where to find data? What sources can be used when country data is not available?

### Fuel prices 

Where to find data? What sources can be used when country data is not available? How to treat taxes/subsidies?

### RE profiles and RE potential 

Where to find data? What sources can be used when country data is not available?

### Demand forecasts 

What demand forecast should be used? In EPM, losses should be included as the demand forecast being in reality the generation sent to the transmission grid.

### Penalties 

1.  VoLL/ Unserved Energy

Lots of debates on the VoLL… The minimum should be the value of alternative generation means ( back up generators), in general around 500$/MWh but it can be much higher in rich countries where an interruption of the grid has economic impact.

2.  Cost of reserve shortfall

Should be higher than FOM + annual capex of candidate generators

3.  Spinning reserve penalty

Tricky, depends on the region/country, in regions where supply is limited we should not prioritize reserve

4.  Surplus power

Mostly for dispatch analysis

5.  Curtailment

6.  Climate backstop technology
