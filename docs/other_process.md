# Electricity Planning Standard Process

Below is a detailed overview of the standard process for electricity planning, which the Planning team usually follows to ensure reliable and efficient power system operation.

## 1. **Context and Objectives of the Study**

Define the context of the planning process. This typically includes either a strategic overview or a project-based assessment. For example, for World Bank projects, a strategic overview may involve a CCDR (Country Climate and Development Report), while a project-based assessment could be conducted during a pre-feasibility study of a new power plant. 

The objectives should be clear and measurable—such as reducing emissions, increasing reliability, or optimizing costs. The context and objectives define the scope of the planning process and its expected outcomes.

## 2. **Set the Energy Context**

Analyze the country’s energy context, including the current energy mix, demand patterns, and existing infrastructure. This helps identify strengths and weaknesses in the current system and informs future planning decisions.

At this stage, it is important to collect Master Plan documents or internal reports that provide insights into the national energy landscape. These may include previous planning studies, energy sector assessments, or policy frameworks.

> Master Plan documents for various countries can be found on the [IRENA National Energy Planning Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODIwYmVhYjktYWFiYy00ZmRlLTljMjgtZGJhMWZlOGVlYjA5IiwidCI6ImNjZGRlYmIwLWQyYmItNDRkMC05ODRhLThlNDJhNWMwNjJiMyIsImMiOjh9&pageName=8db57587b800be86e56c)

## 3. **Install EPM and Run Open-Data Simulation**

Install the Electricity Planning Model (EPM) and run an open-data simulation to establish a baseline for the country’s energy system. This simulation provides initial insights and helps identify areas for further analysis.

The open-data simulation uses publicly available data—such as generation capacity, fuel prices, and demand forecasts—based on standard assumptions made by the CCDR team. It serves as a starting point for discussion with the country team and for refining the analysis.

> The process of running the open-data simulation is ongoing. The team is working to improve data quality and availability.

## 4. **Data Collection and Analysis**

Gather and analyze data on the existing energy system, including generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.

A structured data collection template is available to support this process. It lists all required inputs for the EPM model.

## 5. **Define Scenarios**

Based on the context and objectives, define future energy scenarios. These may include variations in demand growth, fuel prices, technology adoption, or policy interventions.

Scenarios help evaluate different development pathways and their potential impacts on the energy system.

---

## 6. **Run Simulations**

Use the EPM to simulate the defined scenarios. This involves adjusting model inputs—such as capacity additions, technology choices, and fuel prices—to reflect each scenario.

Simulations generate outputs on costs, emissions, system reliability, and other performance indicators, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

## 7. **Create Tableau Visualizations and Share with Country Team**

Develop visualizations in Tableau based on the simulation results. These visual outputs help communicate findings effectively to the country team.

The Tableau dashboards should highlight key performance indicators and enable interactive exploration of different scenarios.

Once completed, share the dashboard with the country team for feedback and further discussion.
