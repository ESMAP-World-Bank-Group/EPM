# Overview

EPM supports two input methods: 
- a single main Excel file 
- a folder containing multiple .csv files. Each .csv file corresponds to a former tab in the Excel file.

While Excel has traditionally been used to run EPM, the introduction of the .csv approach was driven by increased computational capabilities and the need for more robust simulations. This method ensures consistency across simulations by allowing modifications to a single input file while keeping others unchanged.


We provide a template to document the sources for each dataset used in EPM. This ensures clear traceability and consistency in the presentation of information across all inputs.
