# Run EPM on the Remote Server

The World Bank's remote server is designed for **running computationally heavy EPM simulations**.

## Server Specifications
- **CPU**: 4 cores  
- **Total RAM**: 31 GB  
- **Typical Free RAM**: ~6 GB  
- Use `free -h` and `top` to monitor real-time usage.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

You need:
- A **World Bank computer** or access via **VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)**
- A **YubiKey** (only for VDI login)

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're not using a WB-issued device, you **must** use the VDI and your YubiKey.

---

## 2. Connect to the Server

1. Go to [PrivX Login](https://privx.worldbank.org/auth/login)  
2. Sign in with **Microsoft credentials**
3. In the **Connections** tab, click on a host like `Linux-xxx-.worldbank.org`

Once connected, you‚Äôll have access to:
- A **Terminal** (for commands)
- A **Files tab** (to upload/download files)

---

## 3. Clone the EPM Repository

Storage rules

- Do **not** store data, code, or results in `/home/wb_yourID/`.
- Use the `/Data` directory for **all** storage and simulations. This is where disk space is allocated.

Once on the server, navigate to your home directory and clone the repository:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ESMAP-World-Bank-Group/EPM.git
cd EPM
```

To clone a specific branch:
```sh
git clone --branch your-branch-name --single-branch https://github.com/ESMAP-World-Bank-Group/EPM.git
```

## 4. Best Practices Workflow

The server is for running simulations, not for code development. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth workflow:

1. **Test Locally First**  
   Run a simple example on your computer before launching long runs on the server.

2. **Push Your Local Changes** from your computer
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your message"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Update Code on the Server**
   ```sh
   cd ~/EPM
   git pull origin your-branch-name
   ```

## 5. Run EPM on the Server (Option 1 ‚Äì Python or GAMS)

Once your code is ready, you can run EPM on the server using the **same steps as on your computer**.

### A. Python (Recommended)

First time only: You need to add the shared Miniconda installation to your terminal environment. Run the following **once**:

To use `conda` from anywhere on this server, you need to add its location to your system `PATH`.
> This only needs to be done once. Just copy and paste the line below into your terminal.

```sh 
echo 'export PATH="/Data/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
After running this, you can confirm conda is accessible:

```sh 
which conda
conda --version
```

All simulations must be run from the `/Data` folder, not from `/home`.

Each time you run:
```sh
conda activate epm_env
cd EPM/epm
python run_epm.py
```

You can also specify arguments:
```sh
python epm.py --folder_input data_test --config input/data_test/config.csv --scenarios input/data_test/scenarios.csv --selected_scenario baseline
```

> **Important**: The AWS cluster currently only allows downloading files instead of directories. To ensure easier extraction of results, we recommend using the zip option to extract results folder.

To do so, use argument `--output_zip` when running the code. For instance:
```sh 
python epm.py --folder_input data_test --config input/data_test/config.csv --output_zip
```

### B. GAMS (to test if bug does not appear in Python)
You don't have access to GAMS Studio on the server, but you can run GAMS directly from the terminal.
```sh
cd EPM/epm
gams main.gms
# or with arguments:
gams main.gms --FOLDER_INPUT input_folder
```

---

## 6. Run in Background (Essential for Long Runs)

To **start a long simulation and disconnect safely**, add `nohup` at the beginning and `&` at the end of your command:

```sh
nohup python epm.py --folder_input data_sapp --sensitivity &
```

This ensures the process keeps running even after you close the server session.

To verify it‚Äôs still running:
```sh
ps aux | grep epm.py
```

To stop it if needed:
```sh
kill -9 <PID>
```

## 7. Help Section: Terminal Commands

### File Navigation Basics

- **List files**: `ls`  
- **Detailed list**: `ls -l`  
- **Change directory**: `cd folder_name`  
- **Go up one level**: `cd ..`  
- **Print current directory**: `pwd`  
- **Make directory**: `mkdir new_folder`  
- **Delete directory and contents**: `rm -r folder_name` *(‚ö† irreversible)*

### Server Usage Tips

- **Monitor usage**:  
  ```sh
  top        # real-time CPU/memory
  free -h    # memory summary
  ```
- **Find heavy processes**:  
  ```sh
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
  ```
- **Kill a process**:  
  ```sh
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```

### Final Reminders

‚úÖ Test locally first  
‚úÖ Always log out after use  
‚úÖ Use `nohup` for long runs  
‚ùå Don‚Äôt overload the server  
ü§ù Coordinate with others if needed
