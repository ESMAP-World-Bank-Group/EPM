# Postprocessing of the results

This section describes the postprocessing of the results of the simulation. It enables the user to quickly visualize the results and generate standardized figures.

## Structure

The postprocessing is divided into two main parts:
- `epm/postprocessing/utils.py`: Contains the functions to read the results and generate the figures.
- Jupyter notebooks to run the postprocessing. An example of the postprocessing is provided bellow. User need to adapt the code to their needs.

Jupyter notebooks can be downloaded from the documentation to be used for user case studies. The following video summarizes the process:
