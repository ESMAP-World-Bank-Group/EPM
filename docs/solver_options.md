# Solver options
Solving an instance of the EPM model requires solving a mixed-integer programming instance with thousands of variables and constraints. The solver options chosen will then be determining to reduce computational time.

Important parameters include:
- **lpmethod**: determining the algorithm used to solve the LP problem. Options include primal simplex and barrier algorithm.
- **threads**: number of parallel threads allowed. This parameter can speed up the performance of the algorithm. The speedup is far from linear, there is usually a sweet spot between 8 and 12. When setting the number of threads in the config file, you can specify a value higher than the number of logical threads on your computer, as solvers can benefit from oversubscription through better load balancing, asynchronous task execution, and OS-level scheduling. However, setting the thread count too high leads to excessive context switching, increased memory and cache contention, and diminishing returns due to solver synchronization overhead. In practice, performance often improves when exceeding the available threads slightly (e.g., using 12 threads on an 8-thread machine) but degrades if set too high (e.g., 16 threads), as the system spends more time managing threads than solving the problem. Testing different values is key to finding the optimal balance.
- **predual**: Switch to give dual problem to the optimizer. The setting for this parameter can either be a big winner or big looser or no impact if default makes the “right decision”.
- **barcolnz**: dense column handling. Determines whether or not columns are considered dense for special barrier algorithm handling. At the default setting of 0, this parameter is determined dynamically. Values above 0 specify the number of entries in columns to be considered as dense. This parameter can have a huge impact, but is usually difficult to tune, and is specific to each model instance.

**Note**: this list of parameters is far from exhaustive. Detailed information on how to choose the solver options are discussed [here](https://worldbankgroup.sharepoint.com/:b:/t/PowerSystemPlanning-WBGroup/EU2NwUyeOo9CljzcBCJThbsBac_sVZWv7GWmuUWf0XDIyw?e=wLkYhH).
