This section provides a brief explanation of the different types of power plants found in the dataset.

### Thermal Power Plants Types

#### **GT (Gas Turbine)**
- A **simple-cycle gas turbine (GT)** power plant that burns natural gas or liquid fuels.
- Often used for **peak-load** power generation due to its fast startup capability.

#### **ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)**
- A power plant using **reciprocating internal combustion engines**, commonly fueled by **diesel** or **natural gas**.
- Frequently used for **small-scale** power generation or in **remote areas**.

#### **CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine)**
- A **high-efficiency** power plant that combines a **gas turbine (GT)** and a **steam turbine**.
- The waste heat from the gas turbine is used to produce steam, which drives a second turbine, improving efficiency.

### Renewable Energy Sources

#### **ROR (Run-of-River)**
- A **hydropower plant** that generates electricity using the **natural flow of a river**, without significant water storage.
- Provides **continuous** power generation but depends on river flow conditions.

#### **PV (Photovoltaic Solar)**
- A **solar power plant** that converts sunlight directly into electricity using **solar photovoltaic (PV) panels**.
- Production varies based on **sunlight availability**.

#### **WIND (Wind Power)**
- A **wind farm** that generates electricity using **wind turbines**.
- There are two main types:
  - **Onshore Wind**: Located on land, benefiting from steady winds in open areas.
  - **Offshore Wind**: Installed in the sea, where winds are stronger and more consistent.

### Energy Storage

#### **STORAGE**
- Represents a **grid-scale energy storage system** that can store and release electricity as needed.
- Technologies can include:
  - **Battery Storage (e.g., Li-ion, Flow Batteries)**
  - **Pumped Hydro Storage**
  - **Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)**
- Used for **grid stability, peak load shifting, and renewable energy integration**.
